		<h3>Switched to Dvorak?  Hate the remapped shortcuts?</h3>
		<small class = "date">~ July 22, 2011 ~</small>
		<hr/>
		<div class = "entry">
			<p>I recently swiched to the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak keyboard layout</a> and have been
				loving it... except for one thing.  All my keyboard shortcuts are whack!  Most of them now require two hands, and I still accidentally
				use my QWERTY shortcuts quite often.</p>
			<p>However, I'm happy to announce that I've found a solution!  Using a free program called
				<a href = "http://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKey</a>, and a <a href = "shortcuts.ahk">script</a> I wrote, I'm now able to use my
				old QWERTY shortcuts even with a Dvorak layout.  In effect it swiches my layout back to QWERTY only when the CTRL key is pressed.
				Feel free to use my script if you have been having the same frustrations!
