            Ah, holy Jesus,<br />
            how have you offended,<br />
            that mortal judgement<br />
            has on you descended?<br />
            By foes derided,<br />
            by your own rejected,<br />
            O most afflicted!<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Who was the guilty?<br />
            Who brought this upon you?<br />
            It is my treason,<br />
            Lord, that has undone you.<br />
            'Twas I, Lord Jesus,<br />
            I it was denied you;<br />
            I crucified you.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, dear Jesus,<br />
            was your incarnation,<br />
            your mortal sorrow,<br />
            and your life's oblation;<br />
            your death of anguish<br />
            and your bitter passion,<br />
            for my salvation.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, dear Jesus,<br />
            since I cannot pay you,<br />
            I do adore you<br />
            and will ever pray you,<br />
            think on your pity<br />
            and your love unswerving,<br />
            not my deserving.<br />
